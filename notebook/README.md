Mech is a language for developing **data-driven**, **reactive** systems like animations, games, and robots. It makes **composing**, **transforming**, and **distributing** data easy, allowing you to focus on the essential complexity of your project.

You can try Mech online at [try.mech-lang.org](http://try.mech-lang.org).

Usage and installation instructions can be found in the [documentation](https://mech-lang.org/page/learn/) or the [main Mech repository](https://github.com/mech-lang/mech).

## Project Roadmap

Mech is currently in the **alpha** stage of development. This means that while some features work and are tested, programs are still likely to crash and produce incorrect results. There is a "happy path" that works well, but it's quite narrow. We've implemented many language features, but most are incomplete and some are not yet implemented at all. 

The project will hit the **beta** stage of development when all currently planned features have been implemented at least as a prototype. The current target for this milestone is October 2022.
