Fizz Buzz
==========

The Fizz Buzz problem is a simple programming exercise that involves printing numbers from 1 to 100, but with a twist. 

- For multiples of 3, print "Fizz" instead of the number, 
- For multiples of 5 print "Buzz"
- For numbers that are multiples of both 3 and 5, print "FizzBuzz". 

This is a common exercise in programming interviews to test a candidate's understanding of control flow and basic programming concepts.

In most imperative progrmaming languages you'd solve FizzBuzz like this:

```
for i in 1..100 {
  if (i % 3 == 0 && i % 5 == 0) {
    println("FizzBuzz");
  } else if (i % 3 == 0) {
    println("Fizz");
  } else if (i % 5 == 0) {
    println("Buzz");
  } else {
    println(i);
  }
}
```

One of the "tricks" of the problem is that when you implement it using a control-flow statement like `if`,  you have to handle the "FizzBuzz" case first, otherwise you will print "Fizz" or "Buzz" instead of "FizzBuzz"; a naive implementor might code the conditions in the order they are presented in the problem statement, which would lead to incorrect results.

But in Mech we can achieve this in a more concise way. First get a vector of numbers from 1 to 100:

  x := 1..=100
  ~y<[string]> := 1..=100

then replace the values based on the conditions specified using a feature called "logical indexing", which allows us to directly manipulate elements of a vector based on conditions. First we can create an index for all the multiples of 3 and 5:

  ix3 := (x % 3) == 0
  ix5 := (x % 5) == 0

Then we can use these indices to replace the values in the vector `y`:

  y[ix3] = "‚ú®"
  y[ix5] = "üêù"
  y[ix3 & ix5] = "‚ú®üêù"

The statement {{y[ix3] = "‚ú®";}} is equivalent to saying "for all elements in y where the corresponding element in ix3 is true, set that element to '‚ú®'".

Then we can print them all out at once:

```mech
  y
```
