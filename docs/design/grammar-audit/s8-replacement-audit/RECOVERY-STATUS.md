# Recovery continuation after audit acceptance

The review of `d25fbaad01f69c077cb26d4cb0aeadcb4dd1b117` accepts the reconciled
planning baseline and exact-preserving extraction. It does not seal replacement
implementation or accept any silent reduction in required behavior.

The original S8B remains frozen at `662d29b79`. The eleven extraction PRs
#831–#841 retain their original heads and exact final-tree preservation proof.
The original audit observations remain evidence of that frozen baseline; they
are not rewritten as results from a corrective head.

## Confirmed corrective work

R01 / G03 production code is implemented at `7ffeea89f`; head `60e5d534c`
adds explicit feature-enabled CI execution. It is published in
[PR #842](https://github.com/mech-lang/mech/pull/842), targeting E11. Configured
canonical calls and imports now use the existing FunctionEnvironment. The
correction includes per-root callable isolation and the explicit EKF fixture
import required by its ModuleOnly catalog exports. Catalog-free semantic type
probes retain their existing declaration-only behavior; configured production
calls cannot use that fallback.

Validation: 714 runtime library tests, 76 engine integration tests and six new
visibility tests pass; the reduced engine source build and formatting checks pass.
The implementation review at `7ffeea89f` returned with no major issues. The latest-head review
at `60e5d534c` also returned with no major issues; full CI remains required before closure.
No open review threads were present on #831–#841 when R01 was published.

R03 / G25 is implemented at `d0eab6087` in
[PR #843](https://github.com/mech-lang/mech/pull/843), stacked on R01. The binder
uses the canonical schema builder for the union and relocates all schema and
constant references, including lexical match/comprehension declarations.

Validation: 42 strict binding tests, six visibility tests, ten declaration-handoff
tests and 103 engine tests pass; the reduced source build, compiler quarantine
and R3 architecture checks pass. The runtime library run passed 713 tests and
hit one filesystem-watch timeout in the sandbox. The same already-built test
passed outside the sandbox; the sandbox retry failure is retained as evidence.
Recorded outputs are in recovery-evidence/. The review at `d0eab6087` returned
with no major issues; this is not a whole-replacement seal.

R03 executes the previously untested F15 binding/error/remap witnesses, Q30 Id,
Q32 generic Enum, and Q31 Index identity and zero-index validation. Q31's range
endpoint positive remains blocked by the new demonstrated G27 resident
prerequisite, recorded before implementation in
[RECOVERY-FINDINGS.md](RECOVERY-FINDINGS.md). Its strict positive test remains red
on the audit branch. This finding does not reopen G25's schema-order mechanism.

R04 / G26 is implemented at `19abda12c` on
[PR #844](https://github.com/mech-lang/mech/pull/844), stacked on R03. Review
is requested. It preserves already-Dynamic
identity and wraps concrete payloads once. Three regressions exercise changed
payload schemas, concrete wrapping and preservation of existing nested depth.
All 714 runtime library tests, 45 binding tests, six visibility tests and ten
declaration-handoff tests pass. Thus all 31 original strict schema-audit cases
pass across the R03/R04 corrections. Repository formatting and 23 CI contract
tests also pass. This does not close the separate Index range prerequisite or
other replacement obligations. Full CI is requested on the R04 stacked head;
parent correction runs are canceled so that the current head gets runners.

## Scope decisions still required

The accepted baseline does not choose the G02/G17/G18 target capability floor or
the six G12 constrained-type decisions. Their positive capability witnesses and
owning review boundaries remain open. Missing semantic families remain required
prerequisite work under their assigned owners. There is no new generic audit,
blanket exclusion, or resumption of catch-all development on the original S8B PR.
