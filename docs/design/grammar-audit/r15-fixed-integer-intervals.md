# R15 fixed integer interval contract

R15 implements the first G12 constrained scalar form. A kind such as
`u8:1..10` denotes the values 1 through 9. The lower endpoint is included;
`..` excludes the upper endpoint and `..=` includes it. Equal endpoints are
valid only with `..=`. Descending and empty intervals are invalid.

The supported domains are the exact signed and unsigned integer widths 8, 16,
32, 64, and 128. Both endpoints must be closed decimal integer literals that
fit the declared width. Mixed-width endpoints, fractions, floating point,
complex, rational, NaN, infinity, and all noninteger scalar domains are
rejected at the range annotation. Three-operand ranges and their step semantics
are deliberately unsupported in this first form; they receive a positioned
diagnostic rather than an inferred interval meaning.

Endpoints are evaluated once at source admission. Names, effects, captures,
activation-dependent values, and turn-dependent values are not admitted as
endpoints. A constrained kind has distinct kind and schema identity. Its
canonical schema and reified-kind encodings include signedness, width, both
endpoints, and the upper-inclusion flag. Artifact transport must retain that
identity and revalidate values after decoding or rebinding.

An exact-base integer constant can enter its interval only after a membership
check. A live plain integer cannot be implicitly narrowed to an interval.
An interval value can be rebound to its exact base kind by a checked lower
layer, but source typing does not implicitly widen it. Different intervals
do not implicitly subtype one another, even when one contains the other.
Aggregate members and mutable or external values are checked by the
schema-directed snapshot finalizer before publication; an out-of-range value
must fail without publishing a partial state change.

The following paired outcomes are the minimum acceptance evidence: lower and
last admitted value succeed; the value below lower and the excluded upper fail;
the included upper succeeds with `..=`; invalid width, empty interval,
unsupported domain, dynamic endpoint, and stepped expression fail at the
source location; reified identity, aggregate members, external input, state
update, and bytecode roundtrip retain the same interval and rejection behavior.
