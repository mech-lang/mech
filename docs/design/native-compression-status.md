# Native compression: current status

Raw observations, diagnostic drivers, full censuses and rejected experiments stay
outside source. The maintained harness and [compact evidence index](../../benchmarks/mech-deflate/experiments.json)
retain the reproduction path. [PR #973](https://github.com/mech-lang/mech/pull/973)
stays draft pending green CI and clean review. Publication CI is cancelled by
instruction; no green hosted-CI claim is made.

## R99: retire finished ordinary collection sources

Complete eight-byte level-12 compression improves from **8.470875× to 8.363107×
Roc's time**, **1.272220% less elapsed time** against the fresh matched baseline.
All four pairs improve; 61 descriptive blocks improve and three worsen. All
adverse observations remain. There are 3,968 primary and 3,984 total observations.
Blocks within a pair are descriptive, not independent experiments. The reference
is 0.289ms; Mech is 2.448083→2.416938ms. The target is 1×. Larger-input throughput
remains unestablished. R97's historical 8.378794× used a different reference clock;
it is not the baseline of this comparison.

| Metric | Fresh retained R97 baseline | R99 |
|---|---:|---:|
| Instructions, separate 32-call cohort |27,389,660.5|27,947,877 (+2.038056%)|
| Cycles, same hardware cohort |7,732,271.5|7,622,493 (-1.419745%)|
| Allocation requests including reallocations |5,153|5,149|
| Requested allocator bytes |97,997,834|95,900,682 (−2,097,152B)|
| Incremental peak live allocator bytes |17,782,744|unchanged|
| Reallocations |162|unchanged|
| Generated compressor text |14,604,696B|byte-identical|
| Machine entry stack |135,728B|unchanged|

The independent reference hardware cohort retires 1,364,372 instructions and
921,002 cycles. Reference allocation measurements retain 95 requests,
9,021,923 requested bytes and 9,257,328 incremental peak live bytes. These are
observed implementation results, not semantic minima. Hardware, heap, samples
and primary elapsed are separate cohorts. Requested capacity is not initialized
copy volume or live memory. Peak live heap does not improve. Hardware-cohort RSS
is 319,963,136→319,700,992B and footprint is 228,968,128→228,919,040B; these include
prepared code, libraries and harness state, rather than just compressor buffers.

## What changed

The Engine's old-value graph query previously treated CollectionSource as opaque,
so an ordinary completed comprehension could keep its input alive indefinitely.
The query now places ordinary materialized source reads at initialization,
header, body, latch, exit and collection finish. Finish matters: shape-preserving
finalization reads the arena source after the generator releases its source pin.
The same graph traversal preserves backedges, fresh definitions and read/write
order. Unsupported consumers remain conservative. Private-frame eligibility and
Core's current same-account/exclusive ownership check remain in place.

The real tree trace finds aliases 882 and 908 before each update. Previously 882
remained after retirement and forced a copy. After the fix neither remains; all
four 262,144-entry U16 updates reuse their 524,288-byte backing. Four complete
calls verify all 16 updates. This establishes exactly **2,097,152 initialized
bytes no longer copied per complete call**. The trace's arena scan is diagnostic
only; no production owner scan, source-field specialization or algorithm change
is introduced. The selected site's static inventory grows 45→47, adding 882 and
1857. Later readers and externally retained aliases still prevent unsafe reuse.

An independent Mach-O section audit finds the entire generated text byte-identical:
SHA-256 `65099c20101e43aaa1e355c0758a40316fc7ed6aa3ad358b1e0b5c8ba07020d4`.
Object/image identity and ownership metadata change. IR143 reconstructs the
new proof independently on image restoration; rejected R98's IR142 is not reused.
IR/work/private ABI/MBC are **143/99/38/14**, scalar ABI1. Strict prior-image
rejection remains. Price formulas are unchanged; actual logical work falls
42,449,879,781→42,410,605,541 as already-accounted copying/ownership paths change.
Logical work is not a hardware instruction count.

## Instruction tradeoff and fresh profiles

Whole-call instructions increase by 558,216.5 despite lower elapsed time and
cycles. This adverse result remains explicit; R99 is retained for its elapsed
and physical-copy reduction, without an instruction-reduction claim.

Separate nonnested windows around the four tree helpers observe raw instruction
totals 473,722→87,110.5 and cycle totals 209,935→32,007.5 per full call, over 32 calls
per subject. Empty read-pair calibration averages 5,006 instructions; raw window
totals include counter overhead and are not subtracted from the uninstrumented
whole-call cohort. No complete per-function instruction ledger is established.
The whole-call increase remains unattributed outside that bounded diagnostic.

Fresh serial profiles cover 695 complete calls per subject and 1,302/1,293
exclusive sample weights. Copy/move ancestry falls 41/1,302→15/1,293 weights;
frame-action ancestry is 131/1,302→113/1,293. These are overlapping ancestry unions
of CPU samples, not retired instructions or exact timer fractions. Runtime
helper, admission, native-segment and cleanup costs remain prominent.

Retained comparison compiler: `20f002f4ff5ff2186888b7efc8517261756b425e`.
Regression/CI inventory: `bdf3df43a2c0d5dc9483ae3ade9793f85de2a0f7`.
Compiler fix: **`5c219ed220879b05ee147bdf5d3f85680311eae2`**.
Test-only final-root publication correction: `348101721a2870ab2f503508491e7d3395c94b32`.
Stack base: `eacb00fcb3352fbbf3d4dddb7b983f4c130f4a7b`.

The new regression fails against the retained Engine at missing source eligibility,
then passes after the fix. Original/decoded artifacts and original/restored images
cover selected/unselected mapping, current arguments, a later published reader,
external input aliases, unused failing results, assertion/index error order,
unchanged prior publication and retained accounting through failure and retry.
Final managed bytes/nodes remain zero.

Passing current selections: runtime356, work/memory33, native CI65, image1,
unchanged components236, connected8, path1, linked16+12+12, scalar12, frame8,
workflow132 and architecture/type/memory15. CI's guarded inventory is updated
64→65 and actually lists and executes all65. Scalar allowance stays 1.05; the
maximum ratio is 1.018146. Pure scalar requests/bytes stay equal and loop allocation
slope remains zero. Frame request/byte/work counts do not increase. Component
expected values and allowances are unchanged.

Engine, Stdlib, Compute, Runtime and GPU are coherently rebuilt with the same
selected operations, optimized flags and warnings-as-errors. Core, Syntax,
Bytecode, math libraries and external dependencies stay frozen. No fresh Core,
full-math, minimal-dependency or all-features graph qualification is claimed.
The existing expensive knucleotide-body runtime exclusion remains explicit.
Formatting and architecture/catalog/type/memory checks pass.

Preserved preparation failures: an initial diagnostic reporting prefix of16 was
insufficient for45 static candidates and was replaced by a complete inventory;
this was no production resource denial. An initial narrow-arithmetic witness was
outside the retained lowerable subset and was corrected to the compressor's wide
arithmetic/cast pattern. The new test's initial publication expectation was
corrected to the language's final-root rule. No existing component golden changes.
No current correctness/test failure remains; the instruction increase remains
an adverse performance result.

## Fidelity, evidence and next bounded work

Source SHA-256:
`331e659e92181d803b3d87218effe88f711c2e8ecad9f31838fc50991de1c5c9`.
Bytecode SHA-256:
`a2a551911949f8c5fdc64273a43662c2a9c4953b853136c19d196692fdac45a7`.
Level12 retains the 262144-entry U16 tree, 1500513-word U32 cache, 305257-entry U64
path capacity, depth300, nice258 and original near-EOF rules. Search and skip stay
separate. Algorithm, tables, source allocation sites, allocator and evaluate_into
timing stay pinned. Exact raw output is `[75,76,74,78,73,77,75,207,0,0]`, checked by
independent inflate. Input aliases and output capacity13 clear/rebind remain.
Physical public-output backing still changes; physical output reuse is not proved.

Every measured cohort is sealed and committed. Fourteen uploaded evidence
archives verify 1,032 file occurrences, 463 paths and two preserved multi-version
paths. Fresh independent retrieval reproduces all four numerical reports
byte-identically without compilation or compression. The initial automatic upload
rejection was resolved by explicit authorization of evidence uploads. Native
Objects and executables stay local; descriptor/excerpt/hash retrieval does not
establish native-Object retrieval. No larger-input run is performed.

Next, explain the remaining instruction cost using exact callback/ownership
visits, remove the no-witness BoundCall clone, then stage immutable constructor
binding/planning and prepare flat frame-transfer geometry. Current funding,
values, error order and publication remain dynamic. The rejected R98 direct child
seed experiment stays reverted; its 112 executed handoffs were slower and are
not proposed again as unexplored work.
