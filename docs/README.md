Mech is a language for developing **data-driven**, **reactive** systems like animations, games, and robots. It makes **composing**, **transforming**, and **distributing** data easy, allowing you to focus on the essential complexity of your project.

# Mech Documentation

Documentation for the core language and the standard library. These docs are written in Mech and therefore are best viewed running live. They can be viewed online at [https://www.mech-lang.org/learn](https://www.mech-lang.org/learn)

## Project Status

Mech is currently in the **alpha** stage of development. This means that while some features work and are tested, programs are still likely to crash and produce incorrect results. We've implemented some language features, but many are not yet implemented.

Feel free to use the language for your own satisfaction, but please don't use it for anything important.
