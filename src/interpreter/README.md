# Interpreter

The language runtime. It's a small dataflow engine that accepts transactions of changes, and applies them to a compute network.  

## Contents

## Project Status

Mech is currently in the **beta** stage of development. This means that the language is at a suitable stage for a wider audience. While most language feature implementations are started, none are finished, and some new features may, while others could be removed. Backwards and forwards compatibility of Mech programs is not guaranteed at this time.
