## IME and Composition Keys

Keys used when using an Input Method Editor (IME) to input text which can't readily be entered by simple keypresses, such as text in languages such as those which have more graphemes than there are character entry keys on the keyboard. Common examples include Chinese, Japanese, Korean, and Hindi.

Some keys are common across multiple languages, while others exist only on keyboards targeting specific languages. In addition, not all keyboards have all of these keys.

## Function Keys

While various platforms support different numbers of the general-purpose function keys, such as F1–F12 (or F1–F10, or F1–F15, etc.), the first few are specifically defined as follows.

If more function keys are available, their names continue the pattern here by continuing to increment the numeric portion of each key's name, so that, for example, "F24" is a valid key value.
