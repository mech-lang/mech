You can try Mech online at [https://mech-lang.org/try](https://mech-lang.org/try).

Usage and installation instructions can be found in the [documentation](https://mech-lang.org/#/docs/index.mec) or the [main Mech repository](https://github.com/mech-lang/mech).

## Project Status

Mech is currently in the **beta** stage of development. This means that the language is at a suitable stage for a wider audience. While most language feature implementations are started, none are finished, and some new features may, while others could be removed. Backwards and forwards compatibility of Mech programs is not guaranteed at this time.
