# Math Tests

## Basic Arithmatic

Test the following basic build-in arithmetical operations:

- Addition
- Subtraction
- Multiplication
- Division
- Exponentiation

The operations need to be tested on all numeric types (quantities, number literals) to show they work, as well as on other types (string, boolean, reference) to show they don't work.

Test addition
  #mech/test += ["Add quantities", 2, 1 + 1]

Test subtraction
  #mech/test += ["Subtract quantities", 0, 1 - 1]

Test multiplication
  #mech/test += ["Multiply quantities", 8, 2 * 4]

Test division
  #mech/test += ["Divide quantities", 2, 4 / 2]

Test exponentiation
  #mech/test += ["Exponentiate quantities", 16, 2 ^ 4]

## Trigonometry

These functions come from the standalone math machine.

Test math/sin()
  #mech/test += ["math/sin()", 0, math/sin(angle: 0)]

Test math/cos()
  #mech/test += ["math/cos()", 1, math/cos(angle: 0)]

## Rounding

Test math/round()
  #mech/test += ["math/round()", 2, math/round(table: 1.51)]

Test math/floor()
  #mech/test += ["math/floor()", 1, math/floor(table: 1.5)]
